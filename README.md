Bring a bee to life with a bunch of shapes! 

## Additional Changes
I added three new materials: 
- A grass texture
- A stem texture
- A "dandelion" texture (pink dandelions exist in some universe)

I also made some changes to the lighting such that there is only one light source and I increased it's illumination. 

The story for the bee is now this: A lone bee is attempting to pollinate flowers in the dark. A light glows in the distance and the curious bee flys toward it. After flying across the dark field, the bee stumbles upon a mysterious glowing flower swaying in the wind. Instead of pollinating the flower, the glow and sway of the flower entices the bee to endlessly circle around it. This remains the bee's fate for eternity.
